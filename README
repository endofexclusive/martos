M - A Real-Time Operating System

MARTOS is a microkernel loosely modelled on the Amiga ROM
Operating System. MARTOS has support for low level signalling,
semaphores and message queues with blocking and non-blocking
operations.

The kernel is platform independent and easy to port.  Ports
exist for ARM Cortex-M4 (STM32F407/417 microcontroller as
found on the STM32F4DISCOVERY development board).
