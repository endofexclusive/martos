/* This file allows for MARTOS to be be compiled in a single
compilation unit. It allows for compiler optimization to be
performed on functions and data that are private to the OS
but defined in different C files. Use of this methodology
and this file is not recommended as it breaks the idea of C
modules and the performance boost is close to nothing.

To use it, define ONE_NAMESPACE=1. */
