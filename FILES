include/martos/martos.h
This file contains the external interface of the kernel, both
function prototypes and type definitions. It is documented
in Doxygen format. Everything in the file is platform
independent. However, it depends on the platform dependent
defintions in platforms/<PLATFORM>/platform.h


src/default_config.h
Platform independent configuration options are defined
here. Configuration parameters are set using preprocessor
#defines. Each parameter is guarded by an #ifndef expressions,
so a parameter can be overridden defining prior to inclusion
of this header.


src/platform_protos.h
Function prototypes for functions which must be exported by a
platform port. These functions are private to the kernel and
not a part of the external interface.


src/private.h
Here are privatede declarations for source files in src/ dir.


platforms/<PLATFORM>/platform.h
Definition of platform dependent types: TaskContext which
hold low-level information of a task, Ticks which represents
timer ticks.
